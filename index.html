		<h3>Class Reflection</h3>
		<body>
		<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<Li>First week of the boot camp began with introduction, class requirements, theory, and beginning of learning programming languages</Li>
		<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<li>Week two was really focused on learning Object Oriented which I found very difficult, and working on database.   </li>
		<h3>Week 3</h3>
			<li>Last few weeks have been extremely exhausting. We are learning so many different programs in less than 10 weeks. I'm feeling comfortable with HTML, a bit of Javascrip, and CSS. I'm needing more focus on PHP, and SQL to be able to understand more comfortably. Now we have moved on to our capstone projects.</li>
		<h3>Week 4 coming soon</h3>
